   ```python
   # Update moi/settings.py or create settings/prod.py
   
   import os
   
   # For production only
   DEBUG = False
   SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')  # Generate strong key
   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your-domain.com', 'www.your-domain.com']
   
   # SSL/HTTPS Settings
   SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
   SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
   CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
   
   # HSTS Settings
   SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000
   SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True
   SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD = True
   
   # Additional Security
   SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True
   SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True
   X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'
   ```

2. **Generate strong SECRET_KEY**
   ```bash
   python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(50))"
   ```

3. **Test with production settings**
   ```bash
   python manage.py check --deploy
   # Should show 0 issues
