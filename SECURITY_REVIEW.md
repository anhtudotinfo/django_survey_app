**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Review Status**: Pending Manual Review

---

## üîí File Upload Security

### ‚úÖ Implemented Controls

#### File Type Validation
- [x] **Extension validation** - Checks file extension against whitelist
- [x] **MIME type validation** - Verifies content type matches extension
- [x] **Whitelist approach** - Only allowed types accepted

**Allowed Types**:
```python
SURVEY_FILE_ALLOWED_TYPES = ['pdf', 'doc', 'docx', 'xls', 'xlsx', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif']
```

#### File Size Validation
- [x] **Maximum size limit** - 10MB default
- [x] **Pre-upload validation** - Checked before saving
- [x] **Clear error messages** - User-friendly feedback

#### File Storage Security
- [x] **Sanitized filenames** - Special characters removed
- [x] **Organized directory structure** - `survey_uploads/{survey_id}/{answer_id}/{filename}`
- [x] **No direct URL access** - Files served through view with permission check

#### Access Control
- [x] **Permission-based download** - Only authorized users can download
- [x] **User isolation** - Users can only access their own files
- [x] **Admin access** - Admins can access all files

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended Enhancements

- [ ] **Virus scanning integration** - Add ClamAV or similar
- [ ] **Content inspection** - Deep file inspection beyond MIME
- [ ] **Rate limiting** - Limit uploads per user/session
- [ ] **Cloud storage** - Move to S3/CloudStorage for production
- [ ] **CDN integration** - For faster file delivery
- [ ] **File encryption** - Encrypt files at rest (optional)

### üîç Manual Testing Required

```bash
# Test 1: Upload malicious file types
- Try uploading .exe, .sh, .bat files ‚Üí Should be rejected
- Try renaming .exe to .pdf ‚Üí Should fail MIME check

# Test 2: Upload oversized files
- Try uploading file > 10MB ‚Üí Should be rejected with clear message

# Test 3: Filename attacks
- Upload file with special chars: ../../etc/passwd.pdf
- Upload file with null bytes: file%00.pdf
‚Üí Should be sanitized

# Test 4: Access control
- Upload file as User A
- Try to access as User B ‚Üí Should be denied
- Access as admin ‚Üí Should work

# Test 5: Directory traversal
- Try path manipulation in download URL
‚Üí Should be blocked
```

## üìù Draft Response Security

### ‚úÖ Implemented Controls

#### Data Isolation
- [x] **User-based isolation** - Authenticated users see only their drafts
- [x] **Session-based isolation** - Anonymous users isolated by session
- [x] **Survey-specific** - Drafts tied to specific survey

- [ ] **Rate limiting** - Prevent draft spam
- [ ] **Retention policy** - Document data retention requirements

### üîç Manual Testing Required

```bash
# Test 1: User isolation
- Save draft as User A
- Try to access as User B (manipulate URL/request)
‚Üí Should deny access

# Test 2: Anonymous isolation
- Save draft in browser A (anonymous)
- Try to access from browser B with different session
‚Üí Should not see draft

# Test 3: Expiration

- [x] **Validated inputs** - All inputs validated before database

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended Enhancements

- [ ] **Rule complexity limits** - Max rules per section
- [ ] **Performance monitoring** - Track rule evaluation time

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your-domain.com', 'www.your-domain.com']

# HTTPS/SSL
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True
SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True
X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'

# HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)

## üíæ Database Security

### ‚úÖ Implemented Controls

- [x] **Parameterized queries** - Django ORM prevents SQL injection
- [x] **User permissions** - Database user has minimal required permissions
- [x] **Indexes** - Performance indexes on sensitive queries

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended Configuration

```bash
# Database user permissions (PostgreSQL example)
# Create dedicated user with limited permissions

CREATE USER survey_app WITH PASSWORD 'secure_password';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE survey_db TO survey_app;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO survey_app;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO survey_app;
GRANT USAGE ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO survey_app;

# Revoke dangerous permissions
REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM survey_app;
REVOKE DROP ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public FROM survey_app;
```

### üîç Manual Testing Required

```bash
# Test 1: SQL injection
- Try SQL injection in all form inputs
‚Üí Should be treated as data, not executed

# Test 2: Database exposure
- Check database credentials not in logs
- Check database not accessible from internet

# Test 3: Backup security
- Verify backups are encrypted
- Check backup access is restricted
```

---

## üîë Secrets Management

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Security Checks

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Check these are NOT in version control:
- SECRET_KEY
- Database passwords
- API keys
- Email credentials
- Cloud storage credentials

# Should be in:
- .env file (gitignored)
- Environment variables
- Secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
```

#### Configuration Review
```bash
# Check settings.py
grep -n "SECRET_KEY" settings.py
grep -n "PASSWORD" settings.py
grep -n "API_KEY" settings.py

# These should use environment variables, not hardcoded
```

### üîç Manual Checks

```bash
# Test 1: Secret exposure
git log --all --full-history -- "*settings*"
‚Üí Check for any secrets in history

# Test 2: Environment variable usage
python manage.py shell
>>> from django.conf import settings
>>> settings.SECRET_KEY
‚Üí Should not be hardcoded value

# Test 3: Error messages
- Trigger 500 error
‚Üí Should not expose settings/secrets
```

## üìä Logging & Monitoring

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Logging Needs

- [ ] **Authentication events** - Login attempts, failures
- [ ] **File upload events** - Who uploaded what, when
- [ ] **Admin actions** - CRUD operations in admin
- [ ] **Branch rule evaluations** - Track logic execution
- [ ] **Failed validations** - Security-relevant errors
- [ ] **Access denied events** - Permission failures

### Recommended Log Format
```python
# Add to settings.py
LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'formatters': {
        'security': {
            'format': '[{asctime}] [{levelname}] [{name}] {message}',
            'style': '{',
        },
    },
    'handlers': {
        'security_file': {
            'level': 'WARNING',
            'class': 'logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler',
            'filename': '/var/log/django/security.log',
            'maxBytes': 10485760,  # 10MB
            'backupCount': 5,
            'formatter': 'security',
        },
    },
    'loggers': {
        'django.security': {
            'handlers': ['security_file'],
            'level': 'WARNING',
            'propagate': False,
        },
    },
}
```

## üéØ Security Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Malicious File Upload
```
Attacker tries to upload:
1. Executable disguised as PDF
2. PHP shell disguised as image
3. File with path traversal in name (../../etc/passwd)
4. Oversized file (100MB)
5. Zip bomb

Expected: All rejected with appropriate errors
```

### Scenario 2: Privilege Escalation
```
Regular user tries to:
1. Access admin panel
2. Access other users' survey responses
3. Modify other users' drafts
4. Download other users' files
5. Create/modify branch rules

Expected: All denied with 403/404
```

### Scenario 3: Data Leakage
```
Attacker tries to:
1. Enumerate user IDs
2. Access drafts by guessing IDs
3. View error messages for system info
4. Access file URLs directly
5. Inject XSS in survey fields

Expected: No data leakage, proper sanitization
```

### Scenario 4: Denial of Service
```
Attacker tries to:
1. Upload many large files rapidly
2. Create infinite loop branch rules
3. Submit surveys rapidly
4. Create many draft responses

Expected: Rate limiting, validation prevents abuse
```
