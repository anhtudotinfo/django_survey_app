## üéØ Key Features Breakdown

### Section Management
```python
# Create sections in admin
Section.objects.create(
    survey=survey,
    name="Personal Information",
    description="Tell us about yourself",
    ordering=1
)
```

### Branch Logic
```python
# Create branch rule in admin
BranchRule.objects.create(
    section=section1,
    condition_question=question_age,
    condition_operator='equals',
    condition_value='18',
    next_section=section3,  # Skip section2
    priority=0
)
```

### Draft System
```python
# Save draft
DraftService.save_draft(
    survey=survey,
    data={question_id: answer_value},
    user=user,
    current_section=section
)

# Load draft
draft = DraftService.load_draft(survey=survey, user=user)
```

### File Upload
```python
# Question with file upload
Question.objects.create(
    survey=survey,
    section=section,
    type_field=TYPE_FIELD.file,
    label="Upload your CV"
)
```

## üîí Security Features

1. **File Upload Security**
   - File type whitelist validation
   - MIME type verification
   - File size limits
   - Filename sanitization (prevents path traversal)
   - Private storage (not in public MEDIA_URL)

2. **File Download Access Control**
   - Login required
   - Permission check: admin, owner, or public survey
   - Protected view serving files

3. **Draft Access Control**
   - User/session isolation
   - No cross-user draft access

## üìù Configuration

Add to `settings.py`:
```python
# File Upload Settings
SURVEY_FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024  # 10MB
SURVEY_FILE_ALLOWED_TYPES = ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif', 'pdf', 'doc', 'docx', 'xls', 'xlsx']
SURVEY_DRAFT_EXPIRY_DAYS = 30
```

## üîÑ Scheduled Tasks (Cron Jobs)

Add to crontab:
```bash
# Cleanup expired drafts daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/project && python manage.py cleanup_expired_drafts

# Cleanup orphaned files weekly on Sunday at 3 AM
0 3 * * 0 cd /path/to/project && python manage.py cleanup_orphaned_files
```

## üé® UI Components

### Progress Bar
Shows current section and percentage complete

### Navigation Buttons
- **Previous**: Go to previous section (sequential)
- **Save Draft**: Save progress without validation
- **Next**: Validate and go to next section (may trigger branch logic)
- **Submit**: Final submission (shown on last section)

### Draft Resume Banner
Displayed when user has saved draft, prompts to continue

## üß™ Testing

Run system check:
```bash
python manage.py check
```

Test migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate --plan
python manage.py migrate
```

Test cleanup commands:
```bash
python manage.py cleanup_expired_drafts
python manage.py cleanup_orphaned_files --dry-run
```

## üìä Backward Compatibility

All existing surveys continue to work without modification:
- Questions without sections ‚Üí assigned to default "Main" section
- Surveys without sections ‚Üí behave as single-page forms
- No branch rules ‚Üí sequential navigation
- Existing field types unchanged

## üöÄ Usage Flow

### Admin Setup
1. Create survey
2. Add sections with ordering
3. Assign questions to sections
4. (Optional) Create branch rules for conditional navigation
5. (Optional) Add file upload questions

### User Experience
1. User starts survey ‚Üí shown first section
2. Fills out questions in current section
3. Can save draft at any time
4. Clicks Next ‚Üí validates, saves draft, navigates (with branch logic)
5. Can click Previous to go back
6. On last section, clicks Submit ‚Üí final submission
7. Draft automatically deleted on submission

### Resume Flow
1. User returns to incomplete survey
2. Sees "saved draft" banner
3. Automatically taken to last active section
4. Previous answers are pre-filled
5. Can continue from where they left off

## üìà Performance Considerations

- Branch rules evaluated efficiently with priority sorting
- Section queries optimized with `select_related`
- Draft data stored as JSON (not individual answer records)
- File uploads use chunked reading for large files
- Indexes added on frequently queried fields

## ‚ú® Best Practices

1. **Section Design**: Group related questions, keep sections focused
2. **Branch Logic**: Keep rules simple, test thoroughly, avoid deep nesting
3. **File Uploads**: Set appropriate size limits, specify accepted types
4. **Drafts**: Regular cleanup prevents database bloat
5. **Testing**: Test with multiple sections and branch scenarios

## üéâ Implementation Complete!

All planned features have been successfully implemented and tested.
